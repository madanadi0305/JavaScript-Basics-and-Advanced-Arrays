# Index Numbers In Arrays

You can access the values in an array by using index numbers. Note that index numbers start with 0 (`[0]` is the first element in an array and `[1]` is the second).

Example :

```js
var fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
console.log(fruits[0]);
```

Output :
```
```
apple
