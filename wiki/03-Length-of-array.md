# Length Of Array

The length property returns the number of elements in an array. You can use it by simply writing array.length. For example, fruits.length returns 3 because there are three elements in the array.

**Example:**

```js
var fruits = ["apple","banana","orange"];
console.log(fruits.length);
```

**Output:**

```
3
