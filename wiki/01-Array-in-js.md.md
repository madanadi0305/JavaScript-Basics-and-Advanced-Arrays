# Array

You will learn about Arrays which is a type of object in Javascript. If you have a list of items (a list of fruit names, for example), storing each of them in separate variables could become very difficult to manage. A simple solution is to use an array! An array can group multiple values into a single variable. You can create an array by putting the values inside `[ ]` and separating them with commas. The values inside an array are called Elements.

Defining Arrays:

```js
[value1, value2, value3];
```

Examples for Array:

```js
//An Array of string values
["apple", "banana", "orange"][
  //An Array of integer values
  (21, 43, 12)
];
```

## Assigning An Array To Variable

You can assign an array to a variable! In the example below, we have an array with 3 elements and is assigned to a variable with the name fruits. When we print the variable using console.log(), all the 3 values get printed.

Assigning value:

```js
var fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
console.log(fruits);
```

Output

```js
["apple", "banana", "orange"];
```
