# To-Do : Write a JS Program to create an Array.


If you want to create an array in Javascript, you can assign empty brackets `[ ]` to a variable and add elements using comma(,). You can also create an array using new keyword. In the example given below, we created arrays daysOfWeek and fruits then put some elements in them.

Steps:

- Open `practice01.js` file from left folder menu
- After opening `practice01.js`, Copy/Paste the below code in the editor.
- Commit your code to see output in pipeline

```js
var daysOfWeek = ["Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday"];
//array created with 3 elements

var len1 = daysOfWeek.length;

console.log("Elements in daysOfWeek ", len1);
//Prints 3
```
