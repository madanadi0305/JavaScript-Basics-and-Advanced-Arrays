# To-Do : In this demo, you'll learn in which format you will write the code in this module.


In this module, you need to create a function named **konfinity** for each exercise and return the answer in the last line of the function shown below:

Steps:

- Open `practice01.js` file from left folder menu
- After opening `practice01.js`, Copy/Paste the below code in the editor.
- Commit your code to see output in pipeline

```js
const konfinity = () => {
  //your code here
  //calculate answer
  //you can even define another functions here.
  return answer;
};

module.exports = konfinity;
```

This will help us to test your code.

Happy Coding!
